<h1>San Luis Obispo AREDN Mesh Wiki</h1>
<p>&nbsp;San Luis Obispo AREDN Mesh Wiki The San Luis Obispo (SLO) Mesh offers a resilient, high speed digital communications network that is run by licensed ham radio operators. The mesh can be used to support existing emergency communication systems and add increased capabilities and services for the San Luis Obispo Emergency Communications Council (SLOECC) Communications Facilities, local volunteer amateur radio operators, and other users of the mesh. The mesh is setup as a regional Intranet, capable of providing many IP based service that you might find on the internet but in a local, offline format, with the ability to be connected to the internet for long range connections as needed.&nbsp;</p>
